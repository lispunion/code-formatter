A scheme code formatter

## Usage

```sh
$ scheme-format path/to/my/scheme/file.scm
```
Formatted scheme code is output to Standard Out. 

If you'd like to edit a file in place you can use the `-i` option

```sh
$ scheme-format -i path/to/my/scheme/file.scm
```

It is recommended that you integrate this with your favorite editor such that it can replace the current version of your code with the formatted one produced by this.

See [the GitHub Issues](https://github.com/lispunion/code-formatter/issues) for future enhancements.

### Note
This formatter is ok, but needs some love. Check out [the GitHub Issues](https://github.com/lispunion/code-formatter/issues) for some more details. The long term goal is to bring it more in line with the [scheme-style](http://community.schemewiki.org/cgi-bin/scheme.cgi?scheme-style) style guide. 

We can, of course, add in some custom formatting options, but the default should be close to that. Any help you can provide to move us forward would be greatly appreciated. 

## Features
* Runs from the command line
* Makes decisions about line breaks as well as indentation
* Sorts terms such as function definitions alphabetically where this will not change the meaning of the program
* 

## Current Status
A straight port of [code-formatter](https://github.com/lispunion/code-formatter) (previously known as "scheme-format") to Chicken 5.x with a minor amount of cleanup.


## Building From Source
Requires Chicken Scheme 5.x

Just run the `install-deps.sh` and `build.sh` files and add the resulting `scheme-format` file to your `$PATH`

If you edit the `etc.scm` or `format.scm` files you'll want to run

```
csc -s etc.scm -j etc
csc -s format.scm -j format
```
To regenerate the `.import.scm` and .so` files before running the bulid script,  or manually running `csc -static main.scm -o scheme-formatter`
